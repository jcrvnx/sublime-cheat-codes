By Jcrist Vincent Orhen

Step-by-Step Installation

1. Download the Installer
Download the latest MSYS2 installer from the [MSYS2 GitHub Releases](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases) or directly via this link:

👉 [msys2-x86_64-20241208.exe](https://github.com/msys2/msys2-installer/releases/download/2024-12-08/msys2-x86_64-20241208.exe)

2. Run the Installer
- Launch the downloaded `.exe` file.
- Follow the installation wizard.
- System Requirements: 64-bit Windows 8.1 or newer.
- When prompted to set up the Start Menu Shortcuts, accept the defaults.
- Ensure "Run MSYS2 now" is checked before clicking **Finish**.

In the MSYS2 terminal that opens, run the following command:
```bash
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
```
- Press `Enter` to accept the default toolchain group packages.
- Type `Y` when asked to proceed with installation.

4. Add MinGW to Windows PATH
To ensure you can use the compiler from any terminal:

1. Open Settings from the Windows search bar.
2. Search for "Edit environment variables for your account".
3. Under User variables, select the `Path` variable and click Edit.
4. Click New, then add:
    ```
    C:\msys64\ucrt64\bin
    ```
5. Click OK to close both dialog windows.

> 📝 Reopen any Command Prompt or terminal windows to apply the updated PATH.

Verifying the Installation

Open a new Command Prompt and run:
```bash
gcc --version
g++ --version
gdb --version
```

You should see version outputs for each tool.

Troubleshooting

- ✅ Nothing appears when running `gcc` or `g++`: Ensure the PATH is set correctly.
- ❌ Missing GDB? Run the following in the MSYS2 terminal:
    ```bash
    pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-gdb
    ```
- ❌ "The value of miDebuggerPath is invalid" error: This often means GDB is not installed.

> Make sure you followed all steps, particularly the correct `ucrt64` path for your MSYS2/MinGW installation.

✅ MinGW is now installed and ready to use for compiling C/C++ projects on Windows!
