🛠️ Step 2: Apply the Patch

   - Press `Win + S`, type cmd, then right-click → Run as administrator.
2. Navigate to the folder with the `patcher.py`:
   ```bash
   cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Patcher"
   ```

3. Run the script with:
   ```bash
   python patcher.py "C:\Program Files\Sublime Text\sublime_text.exe"
   ```

4. After success, it will output:
   ```
   [+] Patch applied successfully! Saved as: C:\Program Files\Sublime Text\sublime_text_patched.exe
   ```

C. Replace the Original (Optional)
1. Rename original EXE (backup):
   ```bash
   rename "sublime_text.exe" "sublime_text_original.exe"
   ```
2. Rename the patched file:

⚠️ Notes & Warnings

- 🔒 This patch disables license enforcement but does not modify your user experience. It's purely cosmetic and functional.
- 🆘 If Sublime crashes or fails to launch after patching, restore the backup:
  ```
  rename sublime_text_original.exe sublime_text.exe
  ```
